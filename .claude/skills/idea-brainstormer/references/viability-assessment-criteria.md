# Viability Assessment Criteria

## Detailed Scoring Rubric (0-100 Points)

### Overview

This framework provides a quantitative method for assessing idea viability across 5 dimensions. Each dimension is scored 0-20 points, totaling 100 points maximum.

**Viability Levels:**
- **70-100 points:** HIGH VIABILITY - Strong fundamentals, worth building
- **40-69 points:** MEDIUM VIABILITY - Has potential but needs refinement
- **0-39 points:** LOW VIABILITY - Fundamental issues, likely to fail

**Confidence Levels:**
- **HIGH (70-100%):** Multiple independent sources, substantial data
- **MEDIUM (40-69%):** Limited sources, some extrapolation
- **LOW (<40%):** Speculative, needs more research

## Decision Framework

### When Scores Conflict

**Scenario 1: High market, low feasibility**
- Example: 18/20 market, 5/20 feasibility
- Recommendation: Consider partnering, hiring, or simplifying scope
- Could be MEDIUM viability if you can address feasibility

**Scenario 2: Low market, high everything else**
- Example: 6/20 market, 18/20 on all others
- Recommendation: TRASH IT - no matter how well executed, market limits success
- Market size is often the binding constraint

**Scenario 3: High demand, high competition**
- Example: 18/20 demand, 6/20 competition
- Recommendation: MEDIUM - proven market but hard to win
- Need exceptional execution or different angle

**Scenario 4: Low demand evidence, everything else good**
- Example: 5/20 demand, 15+ on all others
- Recommendation: HIGH RISK - may not be a real problem
- Recommend extensive customer validation before building

### Adjustment Factors

**Increase viability score if:**
- You have unfair advantage (domain expertise, distribution, capital)
- You've already validated with customers (pre-sales, waitlist)
- You have unique insight others don't see yet
- Timing is exceptional (new regulation, new platform)

**Decrease viability score if:**
- You're unfamiliar with target customer
- You have no distribution advantage
- You're bootstrapped competing with funded companies
- Timing is wrong (too early or too late)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Be objective** - Score based on evidence, not optimism
2. **Market size matters most** - Can't succeed in tiny/declining markets
3. **Differentiation is critical** - "Better execution" isn't enough
4. **Demand must be validated** - Assumptions about demand are dangerous
5. **Feasibility gates execution** - Can't succeed if you can't build it
6. **Revenue must be realistic** - Fantasy projections lead to failure
7. **Confidence matters** - Low confidence = higher risk
8. **Context matters** - Adjust for unfair advantages or disadvantages
9. **Be honest** - Better to hear hard truth now than after building
10. **Iterate** - MEDIUM scores can become HIGH with refinement
