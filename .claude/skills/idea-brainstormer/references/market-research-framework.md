# Market Research Framework

## Complete Guide to Market Sizing Methodologies

### TAM/SAM/SOM Framework

**TAM (Total Addressable Market)**
- The total market demand for a product or service if 100% market share was achieved
- Represents the maximum revenue opportunity
- Calculated using: Total potential customers × Average revenue per customer

**SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**
- The portion of TAM that your product/service can realistically serve
- Limited by geography, business model, or product capabilities
- Calculated using: TAM × (% of market you can serve)

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**
- The portion of SAM you can realistically capture in the near term
- Accounts for competition, resources, and market penetration
- Calculated using: SAM × (realistic market share %)

### Example Calculation

**Idea:** Project management tool for remote software teams

**TAM Calculation:**
- Global software developers: 28M
- % working remotely: 40% = 11.2M
- Average spend on PM tools: $100/year
- **TAM = 11.2M × $100 = $1.12B**

**SAM Calculation:**
- Focus on English-speaking markets: 60% of remote devs = 6.7M
- Teams of 5-50 (your ideal customer): 40% = 2.7M developers
- **SAM = 2.7M × $100 = $270M**

**SOM Calculation:**
- Realistic 3-year market share: 0.5%
- **SOM = $270M × 0.5% = $1.35M**

### Top-Down vs Bottom-Up Approaches

**Top-Down (Industry-Based)**
- Start with total industry size
- Narrow down by segments and filters
- Good for established markets
- Sources: Industry reports, analyst firms

Example: "Global SaaS market is $200B, PM tools are 5% = $10B, remote teams are 30% = $3B TAM"

**Bottom-Up (Customer-Based)**
- Start with individual customer value
- Multiply by potential customer count
- Good for new/niche markets
- Sources: Pricing research, customer interviews

Example: "1000 teams would pay $50/month = $50k MRR = $600k ARR starting SOM"

### Growth Rate Analysis Techniques

**Historical Growth**
- Look at past 3-5 years of market data
- Calculate CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)
- Formula: CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/years) - 1

**Forward Projections**
- Check analyst forecasts (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
- Look for multiple projections to triangulate
- Assess whether projections are conservative or optimistic

**Growth Drivers**
- Macro trends: Remote work, AI adoption, regulatory changes
- Technology enablers: New platforms, APIs, infrastructure
- Market maturity: Early stage (high growth), mature (slow growth)

**Growth Red Flags**
- Declining growth rate year-over-year
- Market consolidation (fewer players)
- Technological disruption replacing the category
- Regulatory headwinds

### Market Stage Assessment

**Emerging Market (0-3 years old)**
- Characteristics: Few competitors, undefined standards, high uncertainty
- Pros: First-mover advantage, high growth potential
- Cons: Risky, may not materialize, customer education needed
- Example: AI code review tools in 2023

**Growing Market (3-7 years old)**
- Characteristics: Proven demand, increasing competition, standards forming
- Pros: Validated market, room for multiple winners, clear customer need
- Cons: Competition intensifying, harder to differentiate
- Example: No-code development platforms

**Mature Market (7-15 years old)**
- Characteristics: Established leaders, slow growth, defined standards
- Pros: Predictable, large customer base, proven business models
- Cons: Saturated, hard to compete, price pressure
- Example: CRM software

**Declining Market (15+ years old)**
- Characteristics: Shrinking revenue, consolidation, technology replacement
- Pros: Potentially cheap acquisition targets
- Cons: Fighting against trends, limited upside
- Example: On-premise email servers

### Source Reliability Assessment

**Tier 1 Sources (High Reliability)**
- Gartner, Forrester, IDC reports
- Government statistics (Census, BLS, etc.)
- Public company financial statements
- Academic research from reputable institutions
- Confidence: Use for HIGH confidence assessments

**Tier 2 Sources (Moderate Reliability)**
- Industry trade associations
- Specialized market research firms (Statista, IBISWorld)
- Startup research reports (CB Insights, PitchBook)
- Reputable business publications (HBR, McKinsey)
- Confidence: Use for MEDIUM confidence assessments

**Tier 3 Sources (Low Reliability)**
- Blog posts and opinion pieces
- Single-source claims without methodology
- Press releases from vendors
- Extrapolations from small samples
- Confidence: Use for LOW confidence assessments, flag uncertainty

### Data Validation Techniques

**Cross-Reference Multiple Sources**
- Find 3+ sources for critical data points
- If they agree (±20%), data is reliable
- If they diverge (>50% difference), investigate methodology

**Sense Check Against Reality**
- Does $10B TAM make sense for a niche with 10k potential customers?
- Would that mean $1M per customer? Is that realistic?
- Always validate against bottom-up calculations

**Check Data Recency**
- Markets change rapidly, especially in tech
- Data older than 2 years is suspect
- Look for updated reports or refresh data

**Understand Methodology**
- How was the data collected?
- What assumptions were made?
- Is the sample size sufficient?
- Are there conflicts of interest?

### Common Market Sizing Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Assuming Everyone is a Customer**
❌ "There are 8 billion people in the world, if 1% buy our app..."
✅ "Our target market is remote software teams in English-speaking countries (2.7M potential users)"

**Mistake 2: Using Inflated Market Definitions**
❌ "We're in the $500B productivity market"
✅ "We're in the $2B project management tools for remote teams market"

**Mistake 3: Ignoring Market Penetration Reality**
❌ "We'll capture 10% market share in Year 1"
✅ "Realistic Year 1 market share is 0.1-0.5% based on competitor growth rates"

**Mistake 4: Confusing TAM with Revenue Potential**
❌ "TAM is $1B so we can make $1B"
✅ "TAM is $1B, our realistic SOM in 3 years is $2M"

**Mistake 5: Cherry-Picking Optimistic Data**
❌ "One report says $10B, three say $2B, so we'll use $10B"
✅ "Reports range from $2-10B with average around $4B. We'll use $4B conservatively."

## Advanced Market Research Techniques

### Adjacent Market Analysis

When direct market data is unavailable, look at adjacent markets:

**Example:** No data on "AI code review for Clean Architecture"
- Look at: AI code review tools market ($XM)
- Look at: Software architecture tools market ($YM)
- Look at: Developer productivity tools market ($ZM)
- Estimate: Intersection is likely $[calculation]M

### Proxy Metrics

Use indirect indicators when direct data is unavailable:

**For Market Size:**
- Job postings for related roles
- LinkedIn member counts in relevant groups
- Conference attendance numbers
- Related software GitHub stars/downloads

**For Growth:**
- Google Trends trajectory
- Related keyword search volume growth
- VC investment trends in the category
- Number of new competitors entering

### Customer Segment Sizing

Break TAM into meaningful segments:

1. **Geographic:** US, EU, APAC, etc.
2. **Company Size:** Enterprise, SMB, individual
3. **Industry Vertical:** Healthcare, finance, retail, etc.
4. **Use Case:** Specific problems solved
5. **Price Sensitivity:** Premium, mid-market, budget

This helps identify where to focus initially (your beachhead market).

## Red Flags in Market Research

**Immediate Disqualifiers:**
- ❌ Market size <$10M with no growth
- ❌ Market declining >10% annually
- ❌ Only one source claiming market exists
- ❌ "Market size" is really just one large company's revenue
- ❌ TAM calculation assumes 100% of humans are customers

**Warning Signs:**
- ⚠️ Wide variance in market size estimates (>3x difference)
- ⚠️ All data is >3 years old
- ⚠️ Market is "subset of subset of subset" (too narrow)
- ⚠️ No reputable sources cover this market
- ⚠️ Growth projections seem unrealistically optimistic

**Proceed with Caution:**
- 🔶 New market with <2 years of data
- 🔶 Market size estimated entirely bottom-up
- 🔶 Adjacent market used as proxy
- 🔶 Single-source data from vendor-funded research
- 🔶 Conflicting signals on growth trajectory

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always triangulate** - Never rely on a single source
2. **Be conservative** - Better to underestimate than overestimate
3. **Document assumptions** - Make your logic transparent
4. **Validate bottom-up** - Does the math make sense at customer level?
5. **Flag uncertainty** - If confidence is low, say so clearly
6. **Consider TAM/SAM/SOM** - Don't confuse total market with obtainable market
7. **Assess growth trajectory** - Static markets are harder than growing ones
8. **Understand market stage** - Emerging vs mature requires different strategies
9. **Check data recency** - Old data can be misleading in fast-moving markets
10. **Use common sense** - If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is
